<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is John Willett. I am an aspiring Front-End Developer looking to create accessible, appealing, and websites that are easy to use. I am fascinated with the impact that software development has on the world. I started off in other areas of Information Technology, over time I was able to develop my software development craft by learning skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, GIT, GITHub, SQL databases, APIs, and React. </p>

<p>I believe when it comes to front-end the development the user is the most important aspect of it. It starts out the figuring out what the user needs. Moreover, I want make products that are accessible and equitable to the users. I hope to create great products by continuing to hone my skills and putting the users' needs first. </p>
